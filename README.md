# Hello World !

My name is **Ronit Dutta** and I am a final year student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I work primarily in the field of quantum computing and machine learning. I am also very enthusiastic about participating in competitions and hackathons regarding the same. 

## Background

I come from a physics background have spent 4+ painstaking semesters of trying to understand the intricacies of quantum mechanics and the fascinating world we live in (I loved it nevertheless). My bachelor's thesis project was on lattice optimization of spin hamiltonians in kagome geometry corresponding to the heisenberg antiferromagnetic model. My primary areas of research are quantum field theory, condensed matter, quantum algorithms and quantum error correction and communication protocols. ðŸ™‚

## Present

Currently I have been working on a QUBO problem for TSP instances and geometric quantum machine learning. Feel free to approach me for teaming up in a competitions or so. I have won the IBM Qiskit Challenge twice consecutively in 2023 and 2024. I also have participated in this year's QHack and iQuHack competitions (first of many I hope). I am incredibly proud to be working in a field that I love and hope to do the same professionally as well.
